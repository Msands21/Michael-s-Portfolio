# Michael-s-Portfolio
My Portfolio

My portfolio homework for UCF bootcamp ONE WEEK OF CODING EXPERIENCE

**Project Decscription**
In this project, I attempted to build a mock portfolio from scratch using only HTML and CSS. It is not how I would like it but I'm not going to complain too much at this stage in my learning experience.
